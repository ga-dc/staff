"My favorite teacher was my 3-D Art Fundamentals professor during my first semester of college. Her name is Christine Rojek and her teaching style was one that worked very well for me. From day one of that class, it was clear the university defined goals for the class were aimed at teaching more of a fine art approach to interacting with the 3-D world rather than anything design related like furniture or products. However, whenever I approached a project for that class, my desire to build stylish chairs or boxes with sophisticated locking mechanisms showed through and my work came out decidedly non-fine art. Christine, seeing my design ambitions, never tried to steer me away from design, towards fine art. Quite the contrary, she let me play with the objectives of the class so while they technically fit the school's requirements of the class, they allowed me to establish my own goal and get the most out of each assignment. I think being able to be identify a student's strengths and work with them to fulfill the requirements of a class is a skill that I don't always see in educational settings, so it was amazing to work with a professor who could do that.","My former boss Joel Klaff has had a great impact on my life.

In the 90's he turned his love of fabrics into an interior design career which has now turned into an incredibly successful career as a set designer. He lives his life in a very purposeful way and it was incredibly inspiring to work for him and to just be around him.","I'd say the last cool project I did before WDI was designing the constant contact email blasts for my last job at the interior design studio.

But every day, we'd write our homework in our planners, pack up our things and sit back at our desks to listen for our names being called for carpool and Mrs. Dart would read to us.  She'd turn off the lights and read E.B. White classics and then the Chronicles of Narnia.  That was the best part of the day.","There was a teacher at my school named Karen.

"My favorite teacher is Mrs. Tanaka from Hawaii as I grew up being her student in the elementary school. I used to be a little rascal that I usually caused so much troubles. Mrs. Tanaka worked hard to keep me out of troubles by teaching me how to read and speak, then teaching me what is right and wrong. Mrs. Tanaka was already aware of my deafness so she patiently taught me many different things, which caused me to forget about being reckless. When she passed away during my high school year, I couldn't forget how much she had done to me. I have been thankful to her that I learned how to speak and hear English well with my hearing aid that I could involve in a mainstream community. ","Louis Zamperini has inspired me a lot because he was a toughest and bravest man I ever seen in my life. Louis had experienced and survived through many harsh and dangerous situations especially being a war prisoner in Japan during World War II.
 
Louis used to be a rascal when he was little. To stay out of trouble and avoid ending up being immature, he joined track team in high school. In his mind, something told him not to give up, so he kept going until he gain something better. Later, he made to the US track team and went to the olympic in Germany where Adolf Hitler was elected to be the leader of Germany. 

During World War 2, Louis became a pilot of the bomber to fight against Japanese Imperials in the Pacific Rim. He survived the plane crashed when his plane was gunned down by the Japanese plane. Then he survived 55 days being stuck in the middle of the ocean waiting for the rescue. Unfortunately, the Japanese Imperials captured him then put him in the prison camp. 

When he was the prisoner of war, that was when he started to inspired me more. The Japanese prison captain,who called himself the Bird, loved to picked on Louis because he was famous in the olympic, so the Bird tested him on every torture method to see if he was strong enough. One of crazy part Louis faced was that he had his own friends and other American prisoners lining up in front on him. Then each person in the line was forced to punch Louis hard while they take turns. Louis was still standing after all the prisoners finished punching him. He just stood up straight like it is not over. When Japan surrendered, he was still standing. 

In my mind, how the hell he could survive through all of these brutal things? I thought it would be very hard to meet this kind of endurance level like Louis. It showed me that when he can, I can be like him if I don't give up. I believe when his mind was tough as steel, his physical body would be as tough as his mind, therefore, he would be hard to takedown. I am sure that he also had so much stories to tell to his children and everyone else. ",I don't have the last cool project but I can talk about one of my personal work.

I had Professor Grove through my undergraduate studies with my major in Economics at LeMoyne College. He was an excellent teacher who took beyond the basic teachings most students experience with micro and macro economics.

"My favorite teacher was my high school wind ensemble director, Garwood Whaley. I played the flute and the piccolo in the wind ensemble. Outside of our class we practiced after school, played concerts, and toured Europe each year. He expected a lot of his students, but also gave us a lot of freedom and responsibility. He trusted us and treated us like his equal, helping me learn independence.","Sally Ride has inspired me because she was a great scientist who broke into a traditionally male dominated field. I have always been fascinated with space and traveling to space. She she didn't let the fact that she was a woman stop her from following her dreams. There are a lack of women studying and working in STEM fields, and since I am woman working to learn technological skills, her story is inspiring to me.","I worked at The Pew Charitable Trusts on their Clean Energy Program. The program was awarded a grant through the 11th Hour Project, a part of the Schmidt Family Foundation, to highlight unexpected states that have thriving clean energy sectors. We selected 8 states to feature for the project and I was lead author on 2 of them - Georgia and North Dakota. It was exciting to be part of something that is making a positive impact on an issue I am passionate about. I enjoyed the research process and creating a story around each state.",My guilty pleasure is watching Investigation Discovery - murder mystery TV shows.,Sarah Greene,greenesarah,greenes
"I have many reasons why Dr. Abdi Darai is my favorite teacher but I'll only share a few. To start this man is brilliant, he was my professor for Calculus I, Calculus II, and Differential Equations. His teaching style was very thorough and as a student I could tell that Dr. Darai truly had a passion for teaching and mathematics. He always incorporated real world examples of how each subject is relevant to our field of study. Dr. Darai always pushed his students to be the best and no matter how busy his schedule was if you reached out to him for help he made the time to assist you with whatever issues you were facing.","My grandfather is my inspiration! I am inspired by him because of his positive spirit that touches the lives of others without him even knowing. My grandfather is wise, trust worthy, protective, charismatic, and intelligent. I could go on but those are a few reasons why my grandfather inspires me.",I was responsible for creating a Saturday STEM program for local middle school students at Howard University. Through this program students very introduced to topics such as robotics and computer science. They also worked together as a team to complete different projects.,My guilty pleasure is watching the movie Norbit whenever I need a good laugh.,Michael Kendall,@MichaelK_inc,N/A
"My favorite teacher was a professor named Ann Douglas. She taught a seminar on the literature of the Beat Generation and was an incredible scholar. She had lived through the generation herself, to an extent, and had an incredible youthfulness and rhythm to the way she spoke that was captivating. ",I am inspired by Tina Fey because she is an incredibly witty and articulate writer and performer. Everything she makes is expertly observational. 30 Rock never gets old. ,"This previous fall I worked in Buenos Aires with a journalism / documentary startup. I co-produced documentary shorts about water quality and other environmental issues in the city and surrounding province related to river pollution. It was exciting to live and work in a new city, to practice my Spanish, and to make connections with other expats. ",I don't believe in mixing pleasure and guilt. ,Noah Levine,none,nclevine
"One of my favorite dance instructors is Skye Humphries. Not only is he an amazing dancer, but a great, and concise teacher as well. He reads the room and adapts to his students needs. In a huge class, he still takes the time to give personal attention and instruction if he sees it's necessary. He's very creative and insightful, and really helps you grow as a dancer. ",My absolute favorite female dancer is Laura Glaess. A lot of my dance inspiration comes from watching and her instruction. I've been trying to emulate her styling and moves into my own dancing for years. She is a phenomenal dancer and is revered by the dance community all over the world. ,"One of my last cool projects was working on a solo jazz class series. I taught a month long class series by myself which, made me a little nervous at first however, I really enjoy being the sole instructor of a classroom. Designing this class was a challenge because it's a subject that dancers in the area aren't familiar with. It was my goal to make some real positive changes in my dance community and ultimately, there was a big difference in my students and thus the community. ","Obviously, one of my guilty pleasures is talking about dancing entirely too much. A guilty pleasure of mine is occasionally binge watching anime or star trek. ",Ammie Mcculloch,n/a,Vaalys
"My Dad. No matter how much I learn on any subject, I think he'll always know more than me. Luckily he shares some of that knowledge with me.","My wife inspires me most every day. Despite the challenges she has faced in both her work and personal life, she has overcome all obstacles thrown her way and then some. In addition to all this she still has the patience to deal with me on a daily basis.","I had a friend who was a chef while in Geneva. She decided to do a one night only ""pop up"" restaurant on an old sailboat off the shores of the lake. She asked if I would be her ""sous chef"" for the event. I was a very average and amateur chef but of course I said yes. I got to help with the menu, ingredients, settings, etc. Still not sure if I helped more than hurt, but it was amazing to be part of an event like that.

"Richard Squier. He was one of my math / computer science professors back in college. While I only took a few electives with him, his fresh approach to teaching taught me how to tackle radically new concepts. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be taking this program.",I look up to my friends more than I do any one person. Hearing about their experiences in different fields and taking in their advice and lessons learned serves as a constant source of inspiration.,"Last fall my friends and I put on a music festival here in DC. It was exciting, not only because it was something I wanted to do since I was a kid but also it was my first time working on a collaborative project with a lot of moving parts. Like, a lot of them.

Still his nonviolent headache protest to fighting fellow Pokemons for the amusement of children as the children enslaved them and kept them in little confined Pokeballs just to attain shiny little badges never faltered.","My last coding project was in school many years ago and it was not cool, it was just for survival.  so none.","Paw Patrols, cute puppies that can transform to superheroes.",enoch shin,@spmandoo,seekpeace

After dominating the chess world for over 20 years, he's now gotten into political activism, working hard to travel the world and keep Vladimir Putin and the crisis in Ukraine in the public eye even as the high-profile murders of Putin's political dissidents continue to mount.","Moving to the Czech Republic, immersing myself in the culture for six years, and learning to speak the language fluently was the best project of my life so far. It took a lot of intense study, social adaptation and self-insight and growth, and will be an influence on me for the rest of my life.","Chess! I'm a huge geek for it. I learned the game in Czech Rep from a group of drunken old British guys on Tuesday nights, and I taught it for two years in DC and in Berkeley. I study the game more often than I'll admit, and I'm always up for playing.",Ryan Keiper,@TheKeiper,ryankeiper
"I have two:  My 12th grade English teacher, who treated his students like adults and gave their opinions honest considerations in class, and my French teacher the same year, who brought a draconian rigor to class not often seen in the late 20th century; it made her hard to like, but she whipped students into shape and we knew how to speak french better and sounded better than many who had studied far longer.  I'm still thankful to her for that.  ","A good friend of mine who is a high end programmer.  He's an expert in his field, yet always available to answer questions or help out whenever he's needed.  And he's one of the most giving people I know, a fantastic cook (even though he says he hates doing it!), and a blast to hang out with.  ","I wrote one of the main chapters in a market study to help target international food assistance for the US government to a country in West Africa.  Always fascinating to travel and meet with major market players to see what the perceived impact of food aid would be, and investigate whether there was enough logistical capacity to receive, store and transport assistance there.  

I also learned how to write a piece of python code to grab copies of a large set of files (based on their full file paths) and place them in a selected location on our shared drive at work.  I like being able to automate things and that was very exciting.  ","I love finding organization in things - Getting Things Done was a god-send.  I love cooking, and find it a great way to take my mind off things.  I love swing dancing, even though I'm not as half the DC swing dance community.  I love losing myself in trying to play music or sketching even though I'm terrible and feel I'll never get either.  I love doing shots with my family at the holidays (tequila and jaegermeister are big favorites).  I love spending time with my family.  I love speaking French and Spanish, and trying to speak German with my fiancee even though I know I sound terrible and often don't make any sense.  I love visiting markets in developing countries and learning what life is like at the local level, and bringing small pieces of those worlds back with me and filling my life with them, and sharing them with others.

"My favorite teacher was my goofy high school Latin teacher, Mr. Young. I had Mr. Young as a teacher over a period of 7 years and some of my favorite memories came from when I was lucky enough to travel with him and my classmates to Italy to visit all the ancient ruins we had learned about in class. He always treated his students with respect, made us laugh every day and encouraged our curiosity above all else. He is the first teacher I had who cared more about what we were actually learning than about our grades or academic accomplishments. I still consider him a great friend and mentor!

If this question is referring to favorite GA teacher, I would say TBD!","My mother has inspired me. As a single mother of two children for the first 5 years of my life, my mom always worked hard to ensure that my sister and I had everything we needed to thrive. She has always put our education above all else and I credit her with my desire to be a lifelong learner. She has proven that we can all accomplish anything we put our minds to, and has been my #1 cheerleader during this process in which I have decided to completely change careers and pursue WDI. She is an inspiration in every way, but I admire her most for the strength, generosity and kindness she has always expressed even in the face of adversity. ","My last cool project before WDI was helping my previous company, Global Prairie, become B Corp certified. GP is a marketing company that gives back 10% of its profits to local communities and is environmentally-conscious, but had not documented the majority of its achievements over the past several years. I partnered with our CEO/Founder (which was VERY exciting!) to gather all relevant information and worked with a B Corp consultant over a period of 6 months to gain certification. While it was an intense and rigorous process, I was excited to help our company move forward with this long-standing goal and actually see it all come to fruition (we received our official certification last week!).
